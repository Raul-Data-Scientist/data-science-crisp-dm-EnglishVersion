# Welcome!

Hello everyone üëã

Welcome to the Data Science Process using CRISP-DM workshop by Bitlabs Academy. This workshop aims to introduce libraries frequently used by data scientists on a daily basis, whether for analytics, machine learning, or exploratory projects. If you've never written code using Python, you can check out and try the [Data Scientist Starter Kit]([link unavailable](https://syahrulhamdani.github.io/data-scientist-starter-kit/) developed by Bitlabs Academy and translate by Raul Rodrigues (Using Llama 3)

## Prerequisites

To follow this workshop, it is highly recommended that you:
1. Understand the basics of Python programming
2. Understand the concept of modularity in Python and its relation to functions, classes, and packages.
3. Have had mathematics and/or statistics material at the high school level.


## Workshop Outline

During approximately 2 days, we will learn together about:

* Libraries frequently used by Data Scientists
	* NumPy
	* Pandas
	* Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Data science workflow using CRISP-DM
* Workshop Portfolio - Analyzing YouTube Video Trends in Indonesia


## How to Use *Jupyter Book*

We have prepared a notebook for you to use during the workshop, so you don't need to bother setting everything up yourself. You can direct your cursor to the rocket image in the top right corner and choose between *Binder*, *Colab*, or *Live Code*.
* *Binder* will open the notebook using the *mybinder* platform.
* *Colab* will open the notebook using the *Google Colab* platform (**recommended**).
* *Live Code* will use the website to run the *code live*.


## Tips

```{tip}
We recommend using *Google Colab* so you can access the notebook you created.
```

Finally, you are strongly encouraged to ask directly if you experience difficulties, issues, errors, or misunderstandings regarding terms that may arise.
