# Project Description

Welcome to our project! ðŸš€

This repository is a fork of the original project, dedicated to providing English translations from Indonesian it is a [Jupyter book](https://syahrulhamdani.github.io/data-science-crisp-dm/) from a workshop by Bitlabs Academy.

### Translation Progress:
[--------------------] 00%

## Project Overview:

The **Basic Data Science Library** project aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for learning Python applied in data science, with a focus on the CRIPS-DM methodology. 

Data scientists spend a significant portion of their time exploring and understanding data. According to IBM, approximately 80% of a data scientist's time is spent on data exploration. To effectively accomplish this task, data scientists often rely on third-party libraries in Python that are efficient in processing and analyzing large datasets. Some commonly used libraries include:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Hence, our project introduces and explores these four libraries, providing insights and practical exercises for data exploration using public datasets.

## How You Can Help:

- **Contribute Translations:** Help us translate the project content into English from Indonesian. Whether it's a few sentences or entire sections, every contribution matters!
  
- **Review Translations:** If you're fluent in both languages, your help in reviewing translations for accuracy and clarity would be greatly appreciated.

- **Spread the Word:** Let others know about our translation efforts. The more people involved, the faster we can make the project accessible to everyone!

Our team is committed to upholding the integrity and quality of the original project while delivering accurate and coherent translations. We warmly invite contributions and feedback from the community to help us continually improve and expand the English language support of this project.

Join us in making this project accessible to everyone! ðŸŒŽâœ¨
